# Servidor-GB-by-LuisMK
 
This server has no connection with acrisio superSS dev

'base' was created from a server 'released' by it, information, structures were redone and improved

base to work with Global Version was intentionally made by LuisMK

This project was made from 'Zero' using logical reasoning and a lot of technique

If you find bugs, ask a question or try to inform me on discord

the server can work alongside the original database in the JP version

but there may be bugs such as some effects items
